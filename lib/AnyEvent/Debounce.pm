=head1 SYNOPSIS

Create a debouncer:

   my $damper = AnyEvent::Debounce->new( cb => sub {
       my (@events) = @_;
       say "Got ", scalar @events, " event(s) in the batch";
       say "Got event with args: ", join ',', @$_ for @events;
   });

Send it events in rapid succession:

   $damper->send(1,2,3);
   $damper->send(2,3,4);

Watch the output:

   Got 2 events in the batch
   Got event with args: 1,2,3
   Got event with args: 2,3,4

Send it more evnts:

   $damper->send(1);
   sleep 5;
   $damper->send(2);

And notice that there was no need to "debounce" this time:

   Got 1 event in the batch
   Got event with args: 1

   Got 1 event in the batch
   Got event with args: 2

=head1 INITARGS

=head1 cb

The callback to be called when some events are ready to be handled.
Each "event" is an arrayref of the args passed to C<send>.

=head1 delay

The time to wait after receiving an event before sending it, in case
more events happen in the interim.

=head1 always_reset_timer

Normally, when an event is received and it's the first of a series, a
timer is started, and when that timer expires, all events are sent.
If you set this initarg to a true value, then the timer is reset after
each event is received.

For example, if you set the delay to 1, and ten events arrive at 0.5
second intervals, then with this flag set to true, you will get one
event after 5 seconds.  With this flag set to false, you will get an
event once a second for 5 seconds.

By default, this is false, because setting it to true can lead to
events never being sent.  (Imagine you set delay to 10 seconds, and
someone sends an event ever 9.9 seconds.  You'll never get any
events.)

=head1 front_triggered

This flag, when set to true, causes an event to be sent immediately
upon receiving the first event.  Then, you won't get any events for
C<delay> seconds, even if they occur.  These events are lost, you will
never see them.

By default, this is false.

If you also set C<always_reset_timer> to true, the same timer-reset
logic as described above occurs.

=head1 METHODS

=head1 send

Send an event; the handler callback will get everything you pass in.
